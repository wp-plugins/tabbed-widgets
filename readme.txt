Put widgets into tabbed or accordion interface without writing a single line of code. 

== Description ==

See a live demo at [Konstruktors Notes](http://konstruktors.com/blog/ "Writings about the Web, design and development").

Tabbed interfaces are the most common on newspaper type website where they can save a 
lot of vertical space and make it look less cluttered.

Accordion type tabs were made popular by Apple, who use them for grouping different 
types of content in a very narrow sidebar. They are particularly useful if you want 
to have longer tab titles or more tabs that would not otherwise fit into the given 
horizontal size.

= Tabbed Widget features: =

*	Use other widgets for the tab content and specify a custom tab title.
*	Make tabs rotate in a set interval so that they become more noticeable and prominent.
*	Set a random start tab on each page load so that all tabbed content gets equal exposure.
*	Make unlimited number of tabbed widgets that can be then used as regular widgets under ‘Design’ > ‘Widgets’.

== Installation ==

1.    Download the plugin and unzip its content.
